### Overview

The `manipulation` plugin tries to detect a publishing plugin used by a project. It currently recognizes two plugins:

* the legacy `maven` plugin
* the `maven-publish` plugin
* the `gradle-nexus` plugin, [here](https://github.com/bmuschko/gradle-nexus-plugin), which is a wrapper around the legacy `maven` plugin

If one of the above plugins is detected, it is configured to support publication of project artifacts in PNC
environment.

Following properties need to be given either as system properties or as environment variables:

* `AProxDeployUrl` - deployment repository URL,
* `accessToken` - authorization access token (optional)

In PNC above would be already defined as environment variables.

### Legacy Maven Plugin

If the project uses the legacy `maven` plugin, use the `uploadArchives` task to publish artifacts.

Following changes are made automatically:

* custom `Action` is added to all maven repositories of all `Upload` tasks, which overrides versions in generated
  POM files,
* if `uploadArchives` task doesn't exist, it is created,
* `uploadArchives` task is made to depend on `install` task, so that the former is able to consume `pom.xml` generated
  by the latter,
* publishing repository is added.

Loosely equivalent groovy configuration would be:

```groovy
tasks.withType(Upload) {
  repositories.withType(MavenResolver) {
    pom.withXml(new PomTransfomer(...))
  }
}

uploadArchives {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url = System.getProperty('AProxDeployUrl')
      credentials(HttpHeaderCredentials) {
        name = "Authorization"
        value = "Bearer " + System.getProperty('accessToken')
      }
      authentication {
        header(HttpHeaderAuthentication)
      }
    }
  }
}

```

### Maven-publish Plugin

If the project uses `maven-publish` plugin, use the `publish` task to publish artifacts.

Following changes are made automatically:

* new `MavenPublication` is created,
* custom `Action` is added to all publications of type `MavenPublications`, which overrides versions in generated pom files,
* publishing repository is added.

Loosely equivalent groovy configuration would be:

```groovy
publishing {
  publications {
    mavenJava(MavenPublication) {
      from components.java
      pom.withXml(new PomTransfomer(...))
    }
  }
}

publishing {
  repositories {
    maven {
      url = System.getProperty('AProxDeployUrl')
      credentials(HttpHeaderCredentials) {
        name = "Authorization"
        value = "Bearer " + System.getProperty('accessToken')
      }
      authentication {
        header(HttpHeaderAuthentication)
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Manifest Handling

The custom action to update the version will also ensure that the information is correct within the `MANIFEST.MF` files.
The following fields are updated:


Versions are updated for:
* Implementation-Version
* Specification-Version
* Bundle-Version

The JDK is added under:
* Build-Jdk

If the following are not already present then the are updated with the project artifactId:
* Implementation-Title
* Specification-Title
* Bundle-Name

If the following are not already present then the are updated with the project groupId:
* Specification-Vendor
* Implementation-Vendor
* Implementation-Vendor-Id

### Examples

On local machine, you can try following to trigger publication.

For legacy `maven` plugin:

```./gradlew uploadArchives -DAProxDeployUrl=file:///tmp/repo```

For `maven-publish` plugin:

```./gradlew publish -DAProxDeployUrl=file:///tmp/repo```

Project artifacts should be published in `/tmp/repo` where you can review them.

In PNC, `AProxDeployUrl` is already defined as environment variable, so it can be omitted.
