#### Spring Dependency Management Plugin

The [Dependency Management Plugin](https://docs.spring.io/dependency-management-plugin/docs/current/reference/html) is
a Gradle plugin that provides Maven-like dependency management and exclusions.

The Dependency Management Plugin controls the versions of the projectâ€™s direct and transitive dependencies and, as such,
conflicts with the dependency management functionality in GME. Therefore, dependencies managed by Spring Dependency
Management plugin are not currently supported by GME.
