# Introduction

This is a Gradle tool to align versions and dependencies within the project according to some external references. It
excels in a cleanroom environment where large numbers of pre-existing projects must be rebuilt. It is a sibling project
to the [Maven POM Manipulator Extension](https://github.com/release-engineering/pom-manipulation-ext).

# Plugins

Both plugins work in conjunction and therefore the same version is required for each. The analyzer plugin will inject a
reference to the manipulation plugin.

The plugins are compatible with Gradle versions 4.10 through 7.x. Both running and building have been tested on these
versions. It may be possible to run with a 4.x version older than 4.10. However, it is likely that version 4.10 will
remain the oldest version that is officially supported due to major changes between that version and older versions.

## Analyzer

The `analyzer` directory contains the gradle plugin that generates metadata information about aligned dependencies and
the project version.

The latest version of the Analyzer init script can be retrieved from
https://repo1.maven.org/maven2/org/jboss/gm/analyzer/2.9/analyzer-2.9-init.gradle.

## Manipulation

The `manipulation` directory contains the gradle plugin that uses the metadata information generated by the `alignment`
plugin and modifies the project to use those dependencies and project version.
